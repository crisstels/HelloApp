# HelloApp
This is my first attempt to write a REST API. This REST Interface submits 2 numbers and returns the sum of it.
<h2> How can I try it?</h2>

After running the Calculator.py file, just copy this command locally curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"num1": 1, "num2": 1}' http://127.0.01:5000/ in your terminal. Make sure that your input is in JSON-Format only.
